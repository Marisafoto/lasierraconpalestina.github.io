#### Brief academic bio
I am a **postdoctoral researcher** at [Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/), in [Tiohtià:ke](https://www.concordia.ca/indigenous/resources/territorial-acknowledgement.html) / Montréal, working with [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) and [Prof. David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/), since December 2020. I defended my [PhD thesis]({{ site.url }}/thesis.pdf) in 2020 at the University of Osnabrück, which I started in 2016 with [Prof. Peter König](https://portal.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/~NBP/PeterKoenig.html), as a fellow of the Marie Sklodowska-Curie ITN [NexGenVis](https://www.nextgenvis.eu). I obtained my B.Sc and M.Sc. at the [University Carlos III of Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Home) and I have been a visiting PhD student at the University of Cambridge with [Dr. Tim Kietzmann](http://www.timkietzmann.de/) and at the Spinoza Center for Neuroimaging with [Dr. Serge Dumoulin](http://www.spinozacentre.nl/dumoulin/).

#### Current projects
At Mila, I research **applications of machine learning for accelerating scientific discoveries to fight climate change**. With [Victor Schmidt](https://vict0rs.ch/), [Sasha Luccioni](https://www.sashaluccioni.com/) and larger wonderful team, I helped create [ThisClimateDoesNotExist.com](https://thisclimatedoesnotexist.com/), a website to help us visualise the impacts of climate change in our own backyard. Currently, my focus is on accelerating scientific discovery with machine learning. In particular, I am working on electrocatalyst design to improve the energy efficiency of hydrogen storage and other energy-intensive industrial processes, and on DNA aptamer design to develop better sensors.

#### Broader research interests 
Besides developing potentially impactful machine learning applications, I am also interested in **brain-inspired deep learning and computational neuroscience**. I believe that machine learning and neuroscience can highly benefit each other and I am interested in exploring and exploiting their synergies.

#### My vision of science
Besides my research, I am a strong proponent of open science in the broadest sense, and I try to contribute to it with my actions and by getting involved in discussions about how to make science more inclusive, equitable, open, reproducible, transparent and environmentally conscious. Recently, I helped co-organise a [workshop on pre-registration in machine learning](https://preregister.science/) at NeurIPS 2021. At Mila, I am a Lab Representative and a member of the Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee.
