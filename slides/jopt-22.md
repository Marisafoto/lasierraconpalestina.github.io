## Visualising climate change impacts on street photos
### Motivation

--

There is a mismatch between the magnitude of the climate crisis and the public's concern about it.

## Future directions and limitations

* [_ThisClimateDoesNotExist.com_](https://thisclimatedoesnotexist.com) is not an exerise of climate prediction. There is no correlation between the consequence chosen and the address entered. Our algorithm applies a systematic transformation regardless of the address.
    * While this is in part a limitation, this allows us to simulate the impacts of climate change, at any location, regardless of the specific risk.
    * Still, it would be interesting to integrate climate prediction and modelling into our simulations, for other applications.
--
* Our algorithm systematically simulates the same level of water (about 1 metre). It would be interesting to allow for more flexible simulations.
    * An interesting application would be to make the simulations reflect the impacts of various climate actions.
--
* We are currently writing a manuscript with Prof. Erick Lachapelle (UdeM) and Thomas Bergeron (UoT) on a study of the effect of such personalised imagery in climate communication and willingness to action.

## Methods
### Floods simulation with _ClimateGAN_

.context[The algorithm had to be able to generate realistic floods on any photo from Google Street View.]

--

.left-column-66[
Key challenges:

* Visual perception is sensitive to unrealistic scenes:
    * Water texture (reflections, luminosity, etc.)
    * Geometry of the scene (edges, obstacles, etc.)
    * Physics (slope, view point, etc.)
* The algorithm was meant to be deployed _in the wild_ and should work with highly variant range of photos.
* We had to overcome the lack of training data: there is no data set of photos of _before and after_ the flood.

## Methods
### Floods simulation with _ClimateGAN_

.context[Simulating photo-realistic floods is challenging because visual perception is very sensitive to unrealistic scenes and the lack of data.]

--

.left-column[
Key features:

* Data from a simulated virtual word to overcome the lack of training data
* Domain adaptation to bridge the gap between simulated and real photos
* Two-stage flood generation: _Masker_ + _Painter_
* Combination of _depth_ and _semantic segmentation_  to improve water mask predictions
* Conditional image generation to _paint_ realistic water on the predicted mask

## ClimateGAN
### Simulated data

.context[We collected 1,200 photos of real floods and 5,500+ _non-flooded_ scenes to train our model. However, _real_ photos lack geometry and segmentation labels.]

We simulated a $1.5~km^2$ virtual world and generated 20,000 images that mimic Google Street View.

### Human evaluation

_Which image looks more like an actual flood?_

.conclusion[The images from our algorithm were consistently judged as more realistic than those from other methods.]

## ClimateGAN
### Ablation study

.context[We systematically evaluated the contribution of several components of the algorithm.]

* We annotated the pixels a set of _test_ images as _must be flooded_, _cannot be flooded_ or _may be flooded_.
* We proposed 3 metrics to best evaluate the quality of the water masks: error, F05 score and _edge coherence_.
