.left-column-33[
The .highlight1[traditional pipeline] for biological sequence design (as other domains of scientific discovery):
* relies on .highlight1[highly specialised human expertise],
* it is .highlight1[time-consuming] and
* .highlight1[financially and computationally expensive].

### Active learning for sequence design

.context[Machine learning in the loop]

.right-column-66[.center[![:scale 90%](../assets/images/slides/materials/activelearning_ml.png)]]

.left-column-33[
A .highlight1[machine learning model] can be:
* trained with data from _real-world_ experiments and
* used to quickly and cheaply evaluate queries

.left-column-33[
A .highlight1[machine learning model] can be:
* trained with data from _real-world_ experiments and
* used to quickly and cheaply evaluate queries

.conclusion[A machine learning model replacing real-world experiments can _only_ provide _linear_ gains.]

### Active learning for sequence design

.context[Can we do better than _linear_? An agent in the loop]

.right-column-66[.center[![:scale 90%](../assets/images/slides/materials/activelearning_agent.png)]]

.left-column-33[
A .highlight1[machine learning **agent**] in the loop can:
* .highlight1[learn structure] from the available data,
* .highlight1[generalise] to unexplored regions of the search space and
* .highlight1[build better queries]
