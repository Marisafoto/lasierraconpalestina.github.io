## Good practices for receiving feedback on your project

Make it easier for your mentor and you will get the most of out them:

* Prepare a small slide deck for each meeting:
	* Progress
	* Who made what
	* Figures
	* Challenges
* Communication: agree with your mentor on the best communication channel.
	* A private Discord channel can be created for your team and your mentor.
* Discord channels can be created for specific topics
* Email communication:
    * Add on Cc all the members of the team.
    * Add an identifier of the team to the subject of the email.

## Data sets in the cluster

* Storage space in the cluster is limited.
* Having multiple copies of the data sets is both inefficient and a potential source of inconsistencies.
* Some locations in the cluster are optimised for data transfer.

--

Data sets used in the projects should be stored in the dedicated directory for data sets:

* `/project/def-sponsor00/datasets`
* `~/projects/def-sponsor00/datasets`

The two paths above point to the same disk location.

Please be **extremely careful** when dealing with this directory since it is shared by all of you!

---

## Data sets in the cluster
### What to do with the data

1. Copy your data set into `/project/def-sponsor00/datasets`
2. Let me know
3. Take extreme care with the data in this directory
